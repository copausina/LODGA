  heading: Who we are
  text: >-
    Louisiana Oyster Dealers & Growers Association (LODGA) is a non-profit
    association established in 1952 to represent the interests of Louisiana’s
    oyster industry.


    Through the years, we’ve helped ensure the stability of this prolific fishery by supporting research and development projects that enhance oyster growth and production, as well as environmental conservation efforts that protect their habitat. We advocate for policies and regulations that support the industry's growth and success.

  text: >-
    LODGA’s members have access to a network of professionals, educational
    resources, and advocacy support. Our members strive to protect the industry
    against unfair, unjust, and unfavorable laws, legislation, taxes, burdens,
    and extractions.


    In 2005, we established the Louisiana Oyster Community Relief Fund Inc. to support industry-related matters. The fund fosters and protects the oyster industry by working to ensure the industry’s interests are protected.

  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
